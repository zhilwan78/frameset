    <p>Basketball is a fast-paced and exciting sport. It is very popular in the United States, where it began in the
        1890s. It has also become popular in many other countries. In a basketball game two teams of five players
        compete. The goal is to score more points than the other team. They score by tossing, or shooting, a ball
        through a raised goal called a basket.</p>
